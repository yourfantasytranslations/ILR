title: "Prologue"

In the corner of a big dark room, the only sound audible was the clacking sound of a keyboard.
"Finally, done for the day!"

Michio Tsuchida, a 35-year-old employee, was working alone in the office on a weekend like Saturday. After processing some of the week's invoices, he felt like he was doing most of the work and decided to do the rest on Monday.

"Ahh… It's already 8:00 p.m. I want to do a little more, but I don't think I am in the mood to work now."

After saving my work and shutting down my computer, I stood up and had a look around me.

 In the dark office room, only my seat was lit brightly, and the rest of the seats were dark.

I sighed once again and pondered, 'Am I the only one doing work all this time?'

"Ugh… I should stop thinking about it… Decided then! I will treat myself with some premium beer and sleep until tomorrow evening." 

 As I left the office, I closed the front of my coat and began to walk down the street to the station. The time was over 8:00 p.m, but the station was still crowded with people.

"Premium beer ♪, premium beer. ♪"

Michio's head was filled with premium beer.

"Stop, someone, someone, please help me!"

As I reached the plaza, I heard a woman's desperate cry for help from my left. I turned my head in the voice's direction and saw a l
ong-haired man with a disgusting smile on his face.
He was wearing some makeup shades on his face and was holding an eight-year-old girl with a 20 cm knife around her neck.

The woman screamed out, "Stop, please stop! Who are you? What do you want?! Please, let go of my Ai-chan."

Michio looked around as he watched the scene. Not many people were paying attention to this event. Some were passing by as usual, while others were looking at the little girl from a distance. 

"Where is the police? Where are they?!"

When I was pondering about this situation, I saw some people going to the nearest police station to inform them about the situation.

In the meantime, the man grabbing the girl was mumbling something with his cloudy eyes.

"In three minutes, I'll be on my way to another world. I offer this child to Lord Merigus! Please let me be transferred to your world."

The man with a knife was getting enraged. His breathing was becoming ragged.

At this time, I started getting chills all over my body.

Whenever I get these chills, I would change my behavior and escape from that place as soon as possible.

Last time I felt such chills at an intersection of a road. After getting a warning from my chills, I escaped that place in a hurry.

It was only after some hours I got to know that a truck rammed into the place where I was standing before.

"I have to leave quickly. This place isn't safe anymore… But that little girl~!"

'The cops haven't arrived yet.'

I turned towards the police station and witnessed people moving back and forth around it.
I sighed again at this situation.

It was pretty evident that the police station was empty.

"One minute left!" shouted the man, holding the kitchen knife.

"Stop!!" 

Before I could decide anything else, my body was already in action. Without my realization, I slammed with the man holding the knife and saved the girl from his grasp.

Both of us were rolling on the ground. The girl was safe and unscratched. The other party was also rolling on the floor.

But before I could make any move, the man with the knife got up and shouted, "Now I can be free!!"
And approached the girl, waving his knife. I desperately covered the girl and felt a sharp pain in my back.

"Get out of my way!"

The man swung the knife again, intending to kill the girl. My consciousness was fading away, and all I could hear was the sound of running footsteps of several people.

This time, I felt a jolt around my waist.

"Let me go. Let me go near my goddesses."

I could hear the voices of several men saying, "Be quiet and don't be violent. Apparently, the cops had finally subdued him.

"Ai-chan!" The woman pulls out the girl who was underneath me all this time.

"Thank you, Thank you very much."

When I heard the woman's voice, my consciousness gradually started fading.

"Thank you, thank you very much."

I heard a different voice from my mother. And like this, my life on Earth came to an end.
